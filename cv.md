## About Myself:

I took a course in html css and javascript while studying at the university, but after receiving my diploma, I decided to work in a different field of activity. A year later, I reviewed my work done in the courses and decided that it was worth returning to the study of front-end development. Graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics with a degree in Information Systems and Technologies (economist). At the moment I work as an engineer-administrator of telecommunication systems.
